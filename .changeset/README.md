# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code.

## How to add a changeset

1. Run `pnpm changeset` in the root of the repository
2. Select the packages that have been changed
3. Select the type of change (major, minor, patch)
4. Write a summary of the changes

## How versions are managed

The npm packages (`@cadence/core`, `@cadence/cli`, `@cadence/mcp`) are versioned together as a "fixed" group. When any package in the group is changed, all packages receive the same version bump.

The VS Code extension (`cadence-vscode`) is versioned separately and is not managed by changesets (it's in the `ignore` list).

## Publishing

Publishing is automated via GitHub Actions:

1. When changesets are merged to `main`, a "Release" PR is automatically created
2. Merging the Release PR triggers the version bump and npm publish
3. VS Code extension is published separately when a version tag is pushed
